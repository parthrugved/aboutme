ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Parth â€” a 7th grade student with a passion for coding, design, and making learning fun.<br><br>

I love building interactive apps like scientific calculators, currency converters, and quiz games that go beyond the basics.<br>
My projects often include smart features like keyboard support, history tracking, and clean, user-friendly interfaces.<br><br>

I enjoy experimenting with platforms like Python, PyScript, Kivy, and Flask to create apps that work smoothly across desktop and web.<br>
I think like a systems designer â€” combining tools to build powerful and visually appealing experiences.<br><br>

Learning is never boring for me.<br>
I turn study topics into games, flashcards, and creative challenges.<br>
I even invent memory tricks to master tough science terms and spellings.<br>
Whether I'm coding or studying, I always aim to make things engaging, useful, and fun.<br><br>

Thanks for visiting my page â€” Iâ€™m excited to keep creating and sharing more!
